# particle-simulation
A particle system simulates many small objects (particles) moving through space. Each particle has basic properties like position, velocity, lifetime, and color. As time passes, forces like gravity or wind affect the particles' movement. Particles can be emitted from points or shapes, and they eventually die after their lifetime expires.
The simulation usually runs on the CPU for the physics/movement calculations, while the GPU handles rendering the particles efficiently. This creates effects like fire, smoke, water, or magical effects in games and graphics applications.
